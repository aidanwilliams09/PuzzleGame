# PuzzleGame
BFS, DFS, UCS, and IDS graph search algorithms to solve a 6 Tile Puzzle Game.

# Requirements
* python 3: instructions to download can be found at https://realpython.com/installing-python/

# Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository locally
2. cd into folder with solver.py
3. Run command "python3 solver.py"
4. Initial state can be changed by creating a new `State` with your desired starting configuration
5. Board size can be changed by changing the ***board_size*** attribute in `Board`
  * Note: If ***board_size*** changes the total number of elements, remember to change the amount of tiles in the list you pass to the `State` object in solver.py
